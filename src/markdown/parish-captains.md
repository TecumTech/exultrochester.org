# Parish Captains

Thank you for visiting the Exult Rochester Parish Captains webpage. Parish captains are very important to the overall success of the annual Catholic Diocese of Rochester's Men's Conference. Volunteering to represent your parish is a great way to contribute to the annual conference, represent your parish, and meet fellow parishioners who may be interested in attending the men's conference and even getting involved in a parish-based men's group. While many men have signed up to represent their parishes, more parish captains are needed. Click on the link below to view which parishes have captains, and which parishes are still in need.
